# Personal Website

This project is a personal website, serving as a digital resume and portfolio to showcase my skills and experience. As a testing professional with a passion for learning web development, I built this site using React to gain practical experience in front-end development. The website is styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach for rapid styling, and enhanced with DaisyUI, which offers a collection of pre-built, customizable components. Vite was chosen as the build tool for its speed and efficiency in development.

## Technologies Used

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* DaisyUI: A component library for Tailwind CSS.
* Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience.

## Purpose

This project is a hands-on learning experience, demonstrating my commitment to expanding my technical skillset beyond testing and into the realm of web development. You can expect to find information about my background, skills, projects, and ways to contact me on this site.
